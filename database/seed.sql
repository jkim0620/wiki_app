Relatively unknown abroad, the traditional Korean house — called hanok — has become widely popular within the country, and the government is now actively trying to promote its century-old building culture, as seen in central Seoul’s trendy Bukchon neighborhood. In the midst of the hanok boom, my colleagues and I at the architecture firm Urban Detail – Seoul have remodeled a hanok in Seoul’s Myeongnyun-dong area as a joint office for the hanok construction cooperative Chamooree and our own firm. In doing so we hope to contribute to a healthy architecture culture in Korea, embracing both modern and traditional elements. The hanok shares characteristics with its Chinese and Japanese counterparts but has developed very distinct characteristics due to climatic and cultural circumstances. In premodern Korea, every type of building, regardless of its purpose — residential, official, or religious — was built with basically the same techniques and materials. The materials included stone in the foundation, a wooden frame with walls made of clay and tiles or straw for the roof. A traditional hanok consists of a series of bang: rooms papered on all sides — even the floor — and heated through the floor using a system called ondol. Other places worthy of note are the daechong  — the main hall with a wooden floor and visible beams above — and the bueok — the kitchen whose fireplace feeds the heating system for the whole house. Also important in the spatial conception of the hanok is the madang — the courtyard — used as a a semi-private space for both housework and social interaction.', 'Architecture', 'Daniel Tändler'),
('India Underground: the Most Astonishing Architecture You’ve Never Heard Of', 'http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/crop_0_0_3000_4000,scalefit_820_noupscale/5927445f1600002600ddce49.jpg', 'Thirty years ago on my first visit to India, I looked over a mundane wall and it changed my life. This was outside the city of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, beloved by architects for its iconic modernist buildings. But the view over that simple wall had far more impact: I was staring into a deep man-made chasm, with a long parade of steps and ornate stone columns plunging deep into the earth. What was I looking at? No idea at the time. But it was shocking, beautiful, mysterious, and even subversive, since we expect to look up at architecture, not down into it. Entering that startling structure was a unique experience that heightened all of my senses the further I descended. Harsh desert sunlight became increasingly murky, scorching heat gave way to cool air, and the annoying din above ground grew hushed. Tall towers of columns and bridges loomed over me, creating shifting views and perspectives that were disorienting. By the time I’d reached bottom - five stories down - I felt I’d entered another world. Welcome to the world of India’s subterranean stepwells, a vanishing species of architecture that few people have heard of. They were used to harvest water efficiently throughout the subcontinent for over a millennium, starting around 600 A.D. Thousands are thought to have existed, yet they’re all but unknown today, despite being among the most significant structures of their time. Now, most are derelict, abandoned, and often filled with trash.', 'Architecture', 'Victoria Lautman'),
('These Secrets About the Louvre Museum', 'http://www.gf-luxury.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Louvre-Museum-Paris-1078x516.jpg.pagespeed.ce.by3ulOFqgz.jpg', 'In honor of architect I.M. Pei’s 100th birthday, we’re diving into the history of the Louvre: a cultural hub the precedes him by some 700 years, but which owes much of its present vibrancy to his 1980s renovations. First, though, let’s step back in time. The museum dates back to the 12th century, when it was built as a fortress—a fact not many would first associate for the eventual home of the Mona Lisa. Before the Louvre was a museum, it was a royal residence, home to several generations of kings. King Henry IV was among them—and he enacted a kingly ritual known as the Royal Touch in the Louvre’s halls. French royals at the time were thought to have god-given power to rule. One such perk of divine backing? The ability to heal illnesses—such as swollen lymph nodes, a side effect of tuberculosis—with a mere touch. And so, Henry IV received tuberculosis sufferers in one of the Louvre’s halls, anointing the sick with holy water while intoning, Le roy te touché, dieu te guerit”. Modern-day Parisian artists, who spend hours sketching at the Louvre, may colloquially claim to live there. But in the 17th and 18th centuries, artists really did live in the Louvre. Before Louis XIV assumed the throne, several generations of royals had called the Louvre home. But when the Sun King chose to move to Versailles in the late 17th century, it allowed artists to move in. There, they exchanged ideas, copied paintings, and worked on their own projects. The building soon became a nucleus for the art world. After the French Revolution, the Louvre was officially converted from a palace into a public museum. Back then, allowing the public access to great works of art was a novel concept—one that evidently had sticking power. The museum ran on the ten-day week of the French revolution: the first six days of the week were for artists only, the next three offered access to the public, and the last day was reserved for repairs.', 'Architecture', 'Rebecca James'),
('Mediterranean Diet Could Save Your Brain', 'http://thewanderlustkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/vegetarian-tofu-korean-bibimbap-5.jpg', 'One time, I spent 11 hours in South Korea. Technically, it was a layover, but I left the airport to crash in a hotel for a few hours, so I think it counts for something. Tragically, I didn’t have the chance to eat anything while I was there, but that doesn’t stop me from eating plenty of Korean food here in Portland, and whipping up a few recipes of my own from time to time. Bibimbap is one of my favorite Korean dishes, for a few reasons: First, I love anything that is served in a bowl. I’m a total sucker for toppings, and I love enjoying a variety of flavors and textures in every bite. Second, I love that it is easily made vegetarian by swapping out meat for tofu. I love the way the tofu tastes smothered in the gochujang sauce! Finally, I love it because it’s a fun way to enjoy a meal with a group of people. Just give everyone a bowl with rice, tofu, and a fried egg, then let them all build their own  bowl from the variety of toppings on the table. Voila!', 'Food', 'Maggie Fox'),

('John D. Graham and - Another Way of Making Modern Art', 'https://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Two-Sisters-720x720.jpg', 'WATER MILL, New York — Last August, I wrote a piece about - Kali Yuga - (c.1952), a painting in oil, casein, chalk, ballpoint pen, and graphite pencil on cardboard by John D. Graham. It was hanging at the Whitney Museum of American Art as part of the yearlong exhibition, Human Interest: Portraits from the Whitney’s Collection, in a section called Cracked Mirror, which featured portraiture from the years before, during and immediately after World War II. But I had not intended to write about that painting. I was initially struck by a very strange Magic Realist work in oil on wood from 1950 by John Wilde, an artist I didn’t know. Titled Work Reconsidered #1, it was a portrait of the artist’s wife Helen, in which she sits sideways to the viewer, nude, her elbow resting on a starched tablecloth and her index finger pointing straight up at a floating, creased sheet of paper with OBJECTA e. dv. calligraphed in Roman script. Her eyes, in three-quarter profile, directly address the viewer. Her enormous mass of hair is adorned with strings of pearls, and butterflies have alighted on her skin. At first the curious imagery, coupled with the potential for a fresh discovery, held my attention, but after a while its labored technique and throwback motifs began to wear thin, and I found myself increasingly glancing to my right, where, on the other side of a realist rendering of a skeleton (The Shadow, 1950, by Stephen Greene), Kali Yuga hung. In the unsettled time when these paintings were made, the art world was sharply divided, with a few exceptions, between artists espousing experimentation and abstraction and those who rejected them in favor of tried-and-true methods and iconography. Jackson Pollock was already several years into his drip paintings, and Willem de Kooning was about to incite the wrath of the critical mob for returning to the figure with Woman. Greene eventually converted in his late 30s to abstraction, but Wilde remained true to a meticulous, image-based surrealism.', 'Art and Design', 'Thomas Micchelli'),

Michael Townsend, 46, and Leah Smith, 25, who are members of the Tape Art Crew, are using picto tape to create an image of figures in trees that was inspired by trees in Memphis and from the art of painter Carroll Cloar following a trip to the museum last year. Carroll Cloar is a master of trees. He has an absolute love affair with detail, said Townsend, whos been taping for 27 years and is the founder of Tape Art. If you look at his work, its compulsive; every blade of grass; every leaf on the tree.

('The real reason why Spaniards eat late', 'http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2011/10/26/dining/26SUBREST_SPAN/26SUBREST_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg', 'It is 10pm in the Madrid neighbourhood of La Latina, one of the city’s oldest areas, and the cobbled streets thrum with the sounds of people enjoying plates of gambas al ajillo (garlic prawns) and cocido Madrileño (a hearty chickpea, pork and chorizo stew). Restaurants are bustling at an hour when, in most other countries, chefs would be hanging up their aprons for the night. While travellers might attribute Spain’s late mealtimes to the country’s laidback Mediterranean attitude, the real reason is a little more peculiar. Spaniards are living in the wrong time zone, and have been for more than 70 years. Glance at a map and you’ll realise that Spain – sitting, as it does, along the same longitude as the UK, Portugal and Morocco – should be in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). But Spain goes by Central European Time (CET), putting it in sync with the Serbian capital Belgrade, more than 2,500km east of Madrid. In 1940, General Francisco Franco changed Spain’s time zone, moving the clocks one hour forward in solidarity with Nazi Germany. For Spaniards, who at the time were utterly devastated by the Spanish Civil War, complaining about the change did not even cross their minds. They continued to eat at the same time, but because the clocks had changed, their 1pm lunches became 2pm lunches, and they were suddenly eating their 8pm dinners at 9pm. After World War II ended, the clocks were never changed back. However, in 2016, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced that the government was working on a plan to implement a new workday schedule ending at 6pm as opposed to 8pm. One important element of the plan was evaluating the possibility of changing Spain’s time zone from CET to GMT – something that has sparked a heated discussion throughout the country. Being 60 minutes behind the correct time zone means the sun rises later and sets later, bestowing Spain with gloriously long summer evenings and 10pm sunsets. Those who run Spain’s tourist resorts believe that more sunlight is a large draw for visitors. The regional government of the Balearic Islands ‒ which include Mallorca, Menorca and Ibiza ‒ is strongly against returning to GMT and has even campaigned to maintain year-round summer time (CET+1) to allow visitors to take full advantage of the region’s mild winter climate. But for many Spaniards, living in the wrong time zone has resulted in sleep deprivation and decreased productivity. The typical Spanish work day begins at 9am; after a two-hour lunch break between 2 and 4pm, employees return to work, ending their day around 8pm. The later working hours force Spaniards to save their social lives for the late hours. Prime-time television doesn’t start until 10:30pm.', 'Culture', 'Jessica Jones'), ('The Italian Renaissance Is Here', 'https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0VvJWd9L7EJiI9x2vykS6mKK4Cs=/55x0:944x667/920x613/filters:focal(55x0:944x667):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/53501521/QI_9268e.0.0.0.jpg', 'Opening cool Italian restaurants is the new black in Denver in 2017.
