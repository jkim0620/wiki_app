Relatively unknown abroad, the traditional Korean house — called hanok — has become widely popular within the country, and the government is now actively trying to promote its century-old building culture, as seen in central Seouls trendy Bukchon neighborhood. In the midst of the hanok boom, my colleagues and I at the architecture firm Urban Detail – Seoul have remodeled a hanok in Seoul’s Myeongnyun-dong area as a joint office for the hanok construction cooperative Chamooree and our own firm. In doing so we hope to contribute to a healthy architecture culture in Korea, embracing both modern and traditional elements. The hanok shares characteristics with its Chinese and Japanese counterparts but has developed very distinct characteristics due to climatic and cultural circumstances. In premodern Korea, every type of building, regardless of its purpose — residential, official, or religious — was built with basically the same techniques and materials. The materials included stone in the foundation, a wooden frame with walls made of clay and tiles or straw for the roof. A traditional hanok consists of a series of bang: rooms papered on all sides — even the floor — and heated through the floor using a system called ondol. Other places worthy of note are the daechong  — the main hall with a wooden floor and visible beams above — and the bueok — the kitchen whose fireplace feeds the heating system for the whole house. Also important in the spatial conception of the hanok is the madang — the courtyard — used as a a semi-private space for both housework and social interaction.', 'Architecture', 'Daniel Tändler'),

This was outside the city of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, beloved by architects for its iconic modernist buildings. But the view over that simple wall had far more impact: I was staring into a deep man-made chasm, with a long parade of steps and ornate stone columns plunging deep into the earth. What was I looking at? No idea at the time. But it was shocking, beautiful, mysterious, and even subversive, since we expect to look up at architecture, not down into it. Entering that startling structure was a unique experience that heightened all of my senses the further I descended. Harsh desert sunlight became increasingly murky, scorching heat gave way to cool air, and the annoying din above ground grew hushed. Tall towers of columns and bridges loomed over me, creating shifting views and perspectives that were disorienting. By the time I’d reached bottom - five stories down - I felt I’d entered another world. Welcome to the world of India’s subterranean stepwells, a vanishing species of architecture that few people have heard of. They were used to harvest water efficiently throughout the subcontinent for over a millennium, starting around 600 A.D. Thousands are thought to have existed, yet they’re all but unknown today, despite being among the most significant structures of their time. Now, most are derelict, abandoned, and often filled with trash.', 'Architecture', 'Victoria Lautman'),
('These Secrets About the Louvre Museum', 'https://ghadaelgammal.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/641598-the-louvre-pyramid-at-night.jpeg', 'In honor of architect I.M. Pei’s 100th birthday, we’re diving into the history of the Louvre: a cultural hub the precedes him by some 700 years, but which owes much of its present vibrancy to his 1980s renovations. First, though, let’s step back in time. The museum dates back to the 12th century, when it was built as a fortress—a fact not many would first associate for the eventual home of the Mona Lisa. Before the Louvre was a museum, it was a royal residence, home to several generations of kings. King Henry IV was among them—and he enacted a kingly ritual known as the Royal Touch in the Louvre’s halls. French royals at the time were thought to have god-given power to rule. One such perk of divine backing? The ability to heal illnesses—such as swollen lymph nodes, a side effect of tuberculosis—with a mere touch. And so, Henry IV received tuberculosis sufferers in one of the Louvre’s halls, anointing the sick with holy water while intoning, Le roy te touché, dieu te guerit. Modern-day Parisian artists, who spend hours sketching at the Louvre, may colloquially claim to live there. But in the 17th and 18th centuries, artists really did live in the Louvre. Before Louis XIV assumed the throne, several generations of royals had called the Louvre home. But when the Sun King chose to move to Versailles in the late 17th century, it allowed artists to move in. There, they exchanged ideas, copied paintings, and worked on their own projects. The building soon became a nucleus for the art world. After the French Revolution, the Louvre was officially converted from a palace into a public museum. Back then, allowing the public access to great works of art was a novel concept—one that evidently had sticking power. The museum ran on the ten-day week of the French revolution: the first six days of the week were for artists only, the next three offered access to the public, and the last day was reserved for repairs.', 'Architecture', 'Rebecca James'),

('John D. Graham and - Another Way of Making Modern Art', 'https://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Two-Sisters-720x720.jpg', 'WATER MILL, New York — Last August, I wrote a piece about - Kali Yuga - (c.1952), a painting in oil, casein, chalk, ballpoint pen, and graphite pencil on cardboard by John D. Graham. It was hanging at the Whitney Museum of American Art as part of the yearlong exhibition, Human Interest: Portraits from the Whitney’s Collection, in a section called Cracked Mirror, which featured portraiture from the years before, during and immediately after World War II. But I had not intended to write about that painting. I was initially struck by a very strange Magic Realist work in oil on wood from 1950 by John Wilde, an artist I didn’t know. Titled Work Reconsidered #1, it was a portrait of the artist’s wife Helen, in which she sits sideways to the viewer, nude, her elbow resting on a starched tablecloth and her index finger pointing straight up at a floating, creased sheet of paper with OBJECTA e. dv. calligraphed in Roman script. Her eyes, in three-quarter profile, directly address the viewer. Her enormous mass of hair is adorned with strings of pearls, and butterflies have alighted on her skin. At first the curious imagery, coupled with the potential for a fresh discovery, held my attention, but after a while its labored technique and throwback motifs began to wear thin, and I found myself increasingly glancing to my right, where, on the other side of a realist rendering of a skeleton (The Shadow, 1950, by Stephen Greene), Kali Yuga hung. In the unsettled time when these paintings were made, the art world was sharply divided, with a few exceptions, between artists espousing experimentation and abstraction and those who rejected them in favor of tried-and-true methods and iconography. Jackson Pollock was already several years into his drip paintings, and Willem de Kooning was about to incite the wrath of the critical mob for returning to the figure with Woman. Greene eventually converted in his late 30s to abstraction, but Wilde remained true to a meticulous, image-based surrealism.', 'Art and Design', 'Thomas Micchelli'),

('The real reason why Spaniards eat late', 'http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2011/10/26/dining/26SUBREST_SPAN/26SUBREST_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg', 'It is 10pm in the Madrid neighbourhood of La Latina, one of the city’s oldest areas, and the cobbled streets thrum with the sounds of people enjoying plates of gambas al ajillo (garlic prawns) and cocido Madrileño (a hearty chickpea, pork and chorizo stew). Restaurants are bustling at an hour when, in most other countries, chefs would be hanging up their aprons for the night. While travellers might attribute Spain’s late mealtimes to the country’s laidback Mediterranean attitude, the real reason is a little more peculiar. Spaniards are living in the wrong time zone, and have been for more than 70 years. Glance at a map and you’ll realise that Spain – sitting, as it does, along the same longitude as the UK, Portugal and Morocco – should be in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). But Spain goes by Central European Time (CET), putting it in sync with the Serbian capital Belgrade, more than 2,500km east of Madrid. In 1940, General Francisco Franco changed Spain’s time zone, moving the clocks one hour forward in solidarity with Nazi Germany. For Spaniards, who at the time were utterly devastated by the Spanish Civil War, complaining about the change did not even cross their minds. They continued to eat at the same time, but because the clocks had changed, their 1pm lunches became 2pm lunches, and they were suddenly eating their 8pm dinners at 9pm. After World War II ended, the clocks were never changed back. However, in 2016, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced that the government was working on a plan to implement a new workday schedule ending at 6pm as opposed to 8pm. One important element of the plan was evaluating the possibility of changing Spain’s time zone from CET to GMT – something that has sparked a heated discussion throughout the country. Being 60 minutes behind the correct time zone means the sun rises later and sets later, bestowing Spain with gloriously long summer evenings and 10pm sunsets. Those who run Spain’s tourist resorts believe that more sunlight is a large draw for visitors. The regional government of the Balearic Islands ‒ which include Mallorca, Menorca and Ibiza ‒ is strongly against returning to GMT and has even campaigned to maintain year-round summer time (CET+1) to allow visitors to take full advantage of the region’s mild winter climate. But for many Spaniards, living in the wrong time zone has resulted in sleep deprivation and decreased productivity. The typical Spanish work day begins at 9am; after a two-hour lunch break between 2 and 4pm, employees return to work, ending their day around 8pm. The later working hours force Spaniards to save their social lives for the late hours. Prime-time television doesn’t start until 10:30pm.', 'Culture', 'Jessica Jones'),

Only 10 other works have broken the $100 million mark. The sale of the painting, “Untitled,” made for a thrilling moment at Sotheby’s postwar and contemporary auction as at least four bidders on the phones and in the room sailed past the $60 million level at which the work — forged from oil stick and spray paint — had been guaranteed to sell by a third party. Soon after the sustained applause had subsided, the Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa revealed himself to be the buyer through a post on his Instagram account. “I am happy to announce that I just won this masterpiece,” he said in the post. “When I first encountered this painting, I was struck with so much excitement and gratitude for my love of art. I want to share that experience with as many people as possible.” Peter Doig’s 1991 canvas, “Rosedale,” of a Toronto snowfall, which was guaranteed for $25 million, sold for $28.8 million to a telephone bidder, an auction high for the artist. As Phillips pointed out before the auction, the Scottish-born Doig, whose grand, painterly landscapes are prized by collectors, is one of just five living artists who have sold for more than $25 million at auction. The estimate “was aggressive, but it was fresh to the market and had been in a major show,” said Anthony McNerney, director of contemporary art at Gurr Johns, an art advisory and valuation company based in London. Mr. McNerney was referring to the inclusion of the painting in a one-man show at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London in 1998.', 'Art and Design', 'Robin Pogrecin'),
('Aspen Times Weekly: ‘Basquiat Before Basquiat’ at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Denver', 'http://www.aspentimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/arts-atw-052517-3.jpg', 'Before he had canvases to paint on, Jean-Michel Basquiat turned his genius eye and hand to sweatshirts, to a radiator and a television, to a bottle of Pepto-Bismol and on himself. Everything was a canvas for the kid, not yet 20, when he moved in with Alexis Adler at a sixth-floor walk-up on East 12th St. in the East Village of Manhattan in 1979. Hed drag in junk from the street and transform it. Lucky for Basquiats legions of admirers, Adler saved just about everything. And this spring, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Denver curated it into "Basquiat Before Basquiat: East 12th Street, 1979-1980." The fascinating show, which drew road-trippers from here in the mountains and across the U.S., includes just about everything Basquiat made in the year he lived with Adler. The body of work gives us the artist as a young man, just before he broke out as a painter and became the giant of downtown New Yorks legendary 1980s art scene. It boasts reams of archival material — his notebooks, doodles, paintings and sculpture along with Adlers photographs of in-home performance art: sequential shots of a young Basquiat in a football helmet fiddling with a television hes installed in their refrigerator, goofing around in broken eyeglasses and Silly Putty mask, with half of his head shaved to the scalp, and playing the clarinet in the bathroom. He was making money for paint and rent by selling sweatshirts on the street, and many of those garments are on display here, as well. With most artists, this kind of ephemera and juvenilia is left to scholars, boxed up and cloistered away in a university library somewhere and not displayed for the public. Many artists, of course, would rather keep it that way. Ernest Hemingway, when an editor sought to publish old short stories from his high school days, famously rebuffed him in a letter and declared, "It is like publishing the contents of a wastebasket." But with Basquiat, this work seems somehow key to what was to come. Its the warmup before his breakout run of monumental painting — in that way, its reminiscent of another recent watershed Colorado show: the Denver Art Museums 2012 "Becoming Van Gogh." Spotting Basquiats signature zig-zag lines in a sketch here, or one of his famed crowns in a notebook there, whisper of the Earth-shaking breakthrough that will come shortly after he left East 12th Street.', 'People', 'Andrew Travers'),
('Students Build Their Own Factories for Recycling Material', 'http://blogs.newschool.edu/news/files/2017/05/IMG_7032.jpg', 'Max Kitchell, BFA Product Design ’17, ran a hunk of black plastic through the machine and watched as its curled stainless steel teeth churned the material into tiny chips.

“Does anyone want to shred something?” Kitchell said, offering a bin filled with more of the the black plastic to a group of intrigued onlookers.

Kitchell was demonstrating how to use the shredder he and his classmates designed and built as part of Parsons School of Design‘s Build Your Own Factory class. Taught by David Marin, assistant professor of modeling technology, the semester-long course gave students the opportunity to build machines to recycle and reuse thermoform plastics and “mass produce” products within Parsons Making Center.

Inspired, in part, by the Precious Plastics initiative, the class embodies Parsons’ ongoing commitment to teaching students about a range of manufacturing processes and to sustainability through the upcycling of used materials.

“The idea is to create awareness about the recycling process, teaching about the steps of collection, sorting, and cleaning that are all a part of the recycling and reuse of materials,” Marin said, adding that the shredder and other student-build machines could ultimately integrate with Trash Talk, Parsons’ School of Constructed Environment‘s ongoing material recycling program.

In addition to the shredder, students also completed an extruder, a machine that melts and reforms the recycled plastic, and fabricated parts for an injection molder.', 'People', 'Max Ginesin'),
('Tony Whitfield: (Self) Portraits: Two Meditations on the Queer Body at LGBT Center Paris-ÎdF', 'http://adht.parsons.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/RSP-Gazing.jpg', 'Tony Whitfield, Associate Professor of Art and Design Studies at Parsons ADHT, recently exhibited his work at the LGBT Center Paris-ÎdF in a show titled, Tony Whitfield: (Self) Portraits: Two Meditations on the Queer Body.

For Whitfield, all portraiture is collaboration and, ultimately, self-portraiture. Beginning with the nude, he presents works from two ongoing series that explore two critical understandings of himself as a mature, multi-dimensional queer being.

The first focuses on race and desire, delving into his experience as a queer black American whose sexual relations are frequently interracial. In these works, Whitfield employs historically complex conventions of whiteface and blackface masking as means of exposing essential understandings of race and desire in an intimate encounter. For these photos each of his subjects were asked to be collaborators, applying masking color to their faces and genitals and then inhabiting their understanding of that color for a photo-session with Whitfield and his iPhone 6S. In the second series, Whitfield worked with a group of participants at the Stretch Festival held in Village Berlin in the summer of 2016. As an activity integrated into a series of workshops exploring the experience of physicality, spirituality, eros and masculinity for cisgender and trans men, each photo-session became a reflection of the subject and the photographer’s commitment to a deeper understanding of the role of intimacy and vulnerability in queer communities. For Whitfield these work are also manifestations of his ongoing investigation of the notion of the body as our primary queer home. Each of these sessions was a low-tech encounter, shot on an iPhone 6S. In association with the exhibition, Whitfield led Toward a Queer Home Manifesto, a workshop that explores the notion of “the queer home.” The workshop focused on Paris as a chosen home for queer people and invited participants to think about what home has been to them and what it could be based on their experiences, current realities and desires. Participants included new transplants, ex-patriots, refugees, and others who recently chose Paris as their new home.

Born in Philadelphia, Whitfield has been dividing his time between Paris and New York for the last four years. His practice engages his vision and skills as an artist, designer, researcher, project director and administrator in Whitfield CoLabs to create works and contexts that present and interpret aspects of urban experience to illuminate social change, particularly in the lives of underrepresented populations. Through collaborations with artists, designers, technologists and organizations, Whitfield CoLabs’s works are conceived, developed and presented in goal-oriented, and sometimes multiple, environments. Employing transmedia storytelling strategies, audiences for and participants in Whitfield CoLabs’ works range from the art world to general populations in public spaces to workshop members to product consumers to participants in social media. Currently, Whitfield is developing This Dancerie a cycle of works exploring Paris as the site of a queer century lived in public in a multi-event, multi-site, multi-media project that explores the ways in which gay men have created public expressions of desire despite prohibitions against the manifestation of those aspects of their live.

Tony Whitfield’s has shown internationally in solo and group exhibitions in galleries and museums including the New York’s Museum of Art and Design, Leslie Lohman Museum of Lesbian and Gay Art, and the Instituto Cultural Peruano Norteamericano in Lima, Peru. Whitfield has also written about art, new media, film, performance and design and been Director of Printed Matter, Inc., Associate Director of Lower Manhattan Cultural Council and Senior Policy Analyst for Cultural Affairs for the Manhattan Borough President. An Associate Professor of Art and Design Practice he has also served as Associate Dean for Civic Engagement at Parsons School of Design.', 'People', 'Daren '),

('The Oppressive Gospel of Minimalism', 'https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/31/magazine/31firstwords/31firstwords-master768-v2.jpg', 'It has become an ostentatious ritual of consumerist self-sacrifice; people who have it all now seem to prefer having nothing at all. And, as with watching birds or going Paleo, talking about the material purge is just as important as actually doing it. So there are blog posts — in which you can see minimalisms can-do optimism curdle into something tyrannical. A recent account, called How Minimalism Brought Me Freedom and Joy, is emblematic of the budding genre, from its author (a wealthy serial entrepreneur, James Altucher) to its thesis (own fewer things, mostly gadgets) to its one-sentence paragraphs. Altucher explains that he gave up his permanent home, life goals and negative emotions. He threw away his college diploma, which had been gathering dust in storage. (I dont hold onto all the things society tells me to hold onto.) He now carries nothing but a bag of clothes and a backpack containing a computer, an iPad and a smartphone. I have zero other possessions, he writes, and thanks to this, he has found peace as a wandering techno-ascetic — Silicon Valleys version of Zen monkhood.Despite its connotations of absence, minimalism has been popping up everywhere lately, like a bright algae bloom in the murk of postrecession America. From tiny houses to microapartments to monochromatic clothing to interior-decorating trends — picture white walls interrupted only by succulents — less now goes further than ever. Its easy to feel overwhelmed by the minimalism glut, as the word can be applied to just about anything. The nearly four million images tagged minimalism on Instagram include white sneakers, clouds, the works of Mondrian, neon signs, crumbling brick walls and grassy fields. So long as its stylishly austere, it seems, its minimalist. Part pop philosophy and part aesthetic, minimalism presents a cure-all for a certain sense of capitalist overindulgence. Maybe we have a hangover from pre-recession excess — McMansions, S.U.V.s, neon cocktails, fusion cuisine — and minimalism is the salutary tonic. Or perhaps its a method of coping with recession-induced austerity, a collective spiritual and cultural cleanse because weve been forced to consume less anyway. But as an outgrowth of a peculiarly American (that is to say, paradoxical and self-defeating) brand of Puritanical asceticism, this new minimalist lifestyle always seems to end in enabling new modes of consumption, a veritable excess of less. Its not really minimal at all. The words meaning wasnt entirely literal when it first came into being; minimalism was popularized in 1965 as an insult. In an essay for Arts Magazine, the British philosopher Richard Wollheim used it to describe a group of artists whose work was characterized by minimal art content — that is, a lack of art. Arranging bricks on a gallery floor (as Carl Andre did) or manufacturing metal boxes (Donald Judd) or fluorescent light fixtures (Dan Flavin) simply wasnt, in Wollheims estimation, enough to make an object worthy of the title. For good reason, the artists singled out in the essay didnt identify with Wollheims appellation. They used industrial materials to remove themselves from their work, intentionally. In their eyes, this formal frugality was a necessary correction to the heroic individualism of New York School Abstract Expressionism. (After some time, what can you see in a Pollock but Pollock himself?) But the name stuck. Still, the artists were maximalists of a sort: The austerity of their objects freed the viewer to experience the work in any way they wished. Minimalism can return you to this basic state where youre perceiving purely, says David Raskin, a professor of contemporary art history at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Less is more because you strip away the familiar, opening an opportunity to see the world without preconceptions. The objects might look mundane, but rather than the plain metal box on the floor, its the stark sensory experience the object incites that is the art, no previous knowledge necessary. The artist opens a radical infinity of possibilities. Minimalism in the 1960s was very much along the lines of taking LSD, says Miguel de Baca, an associate professor of art history at Lake Forest College. Minimalism was eventually canonized as an art-historical movement, but the name came to mean something different as it was adopted into consumer culture and turned into a class signifier. What was once a way artists shocked viewers became over the decades a style as delimited and consumable as any Martha Stewart tablescape. The word was defanged, no longer a critical insult and no longer a viable strategy within art — though it never quite gave up its veneer of provocation. Even austerity can be made decadent: To wealthy practitioners, minimalism is now little more than a slightly intriguing perversion, like drinking at breakfast. One of the real problems with design-world minimalism is that its just become a signifier of the global elite, Raskin says. The richer you are, the less you have. The minimalists aesthetic of raw materials and aggressive simplicity leaked into fashion, design and architecture, where it became a luxury product, helped along at times by the artists themselves. Judds SoHo loft building is now an icon of sanitized minimalism, open to tourists. His Chinati Foundation, a permanent installation of concrete and metal boxes in and around a decommissioned military base in Marfa, Tex., is a site of hipster pilgrimage. It even appears in Ben Lerne 10:04, a novel redolent of late-capitalist anxiety. The protagonist visits the town on an artists residency, where he wanders the desert landscape, parties with young people and accidentally ingests ketamine — but it is Judds installation that provides an epiphany. The sculptures, he writes, combined to collapse my sense of inside and outside. Judds work had itself come to contain the world.', 'Culture', 'Kyle Chayka');
